        <h3>our team</h3>
        <p>Psychologists study cognitive functioning and behavior, and use their knowledge to assist clients with the treatment or management of mental health and behavioral difficulties. A psychologist is someone who has an intuitive understanding of people and their needs. The best ones are driven by compassion, creativity, and truth-telling abilities.</p>
        <p>Some psychologists work alone, but when several specialists come together beautiful things happen. We can take as example the intelligent cloud which acts as a professional psychologist. Our team invested a lot of knowledge in this chatbot and provide with him the best techniques for helping people around the world.</p>
          <p>Do you feel that your problem is more complex and you would like to contact a human specialist? Below you have some contact information about each team member. Feel free to talk to them! üåü</p>
